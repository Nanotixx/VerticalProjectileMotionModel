# Vertical Projectile Motion Model
Simulate the value of a vertical projectile motion or use it for the jumping logic in your games! (This is my 4th project as in Python aside from the New Years).

I solely made this because I have been learning basic physics lately. This is one of my breakthrough for my game development journey!

Use it or modify it, do whatever you want! :D
